\subsection{Releases}\label{releases}

Releases can be done via github actions and the built jar and users can
download it on the
\href{https://github.com/ratschlab/medical-reports-deidentification/releases}{github
release page}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Adapt the version in the \texttt{\textless{}version\textgreater{}}
  section of \href{/deidentifier-pipeline/pom.xml}{maven config}
\item
  merge this change into main
\item
  create a tag locally on your computer using
  \texttt{git\ tag\ v{[}version{]}}, e.g.~\texttt{git\ tag\ v1.0.0}
\item
  push tag using \texttt{git\ push\ origin\ v1.0.0} (adapt to the
  version)
\item
  If the github actions workflow ran successfully, you can edit the
  release as necessary on the
  \href{https://github.com/ratschlab/medical-reports-deidentification/releases}{github
  release page} and switch it from Pre-release to release (remove the
  flag \texttt{This\ is\ a\ pre-release})
\end{enumerate}

Note, that there is a danger that the version in \texttt{pom.xml} and in
the git tag don't match. This could/should be streamlined in the future.
